# Supplement to Shcherbatyi, Iaroslav, and Bjoern Andres. "Convexification of Learning from Constraints." arXiv preprint arXiv:1602.06746 (2016).

This python code implements the convex extension of the user defined function. For some of the functions, their optimized convex extensions are available. 

You need python 2.7 to use this repository, together with standard python scientific computing routines like numpy, scipy. The easiest way to install those is to use [Anaconda distribution.](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

This code should work on Windows, Mac OS and Linux. If not, please let me know.
